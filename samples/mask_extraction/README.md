# Mask Extraction Methods


## Get started
* [background_model.py](background_model.py). This script implements several background subtraction methods.
* [optical_flow.py](optical_flow.py). This script segments dynamic regions based on optical flow between ego-motion frames.
* [ransac_keypoints_matching.py](ransac_keypoints_matching.py). This script uses RANSAC to find match key points between two frames, in order to segment dynamic regions.
* [mask_extraction.py](mask_extraction.py). This script implements our proposed mask extraction method for real-world data.
* [Mask_Extraction_Visualization.ipynb](Mask_Extraction_Visualization.ipynb). This 
notebook can be used to visualize the intermediate results produced by [mask_extraction.py](mask_extraction.py).
